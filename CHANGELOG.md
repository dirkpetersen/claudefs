# ClaudeFS Changelog

All notable changes to the ClaudeFS project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Phase 1: Foundation

#### 2026-02-28

##### A11: Infrastructure & CI (COMPLETE ✅)
- Cargo workspace root created with 8 agent-owned crates
- Each crate configured with shared dependencies (tokio, thiserror, serde, tracing, prost/tonic)
- Module stubs for major subsystems in each crate ready for agent implementation
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline set up with per-crate testing, clippy linting, fmt checks, doc validation
- All crates compile successfully with `make check` passing (build, test, clippy, fmt, doc)
- `.gitignore` added to prevent build artifacts and temporary files from repository
- Infrastructure status: orchestrator-user-data.sh, storage-node-user-data.sh, client-node-user-data.sh, cfs-dev CLI, cfs-cost-monitor, IAM policies all complete
- PHASE1_READINESS.md created as comprehensive onboarding guide
- Development section added to README with workflow and tool documentation
- Metadata crate: Complete type definitions for Raft consensus, inode operations, replication
- Storage crate: Error types for block operations (StorageError enum with 10 variants)
- **PHASE 1 FOUNDATION: COMPLETE & READY FOR BUILDER AGENTS** ✅
  - All CI checks passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
  - All builder agents (A1, A2, A3, A4) can begin implementation immediately
  - Infrastructure provisioned, tooling validated, documentation complete

##### A3: Data Reduction (COMPLETE ✅)
- Full `claudefs-reduce` crate Phase 1: standalone pure-Rust data reduction library
- FastCDC variable-length chunking (32KB min, 64KB avg, 512KB max) via `fastcdc` crate
- BLAKE3 content fingerprinting for exact-match CAS deduplication
- MinHash Super-Features (4 FNV-1a region hashes) for similarity detection
- LZ4 inline compression (hot write path) with compressibility heuristic check
- Zstd dictionary compression for background similarity-based delta compression
- AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption with per-chunk HKDF-SHA256 key derivation
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 fallback for hardware without AES-NI acceleration
- In-memory CAS index with reference counting for Phase 1
- Full write pipeline: chunk → dedupe → compress → encrypt → ReducedChunk
- Full read pipeline: decrypt → decompress → reassemble original data
- 25 unit + property-based tests all passing (proptest roundtrip invariants)
- Zero clippy warnings; no unsafe code (pure safe Rust per A3 spec)
- Pipeline order per docs/reduction.md: dedupe → compress → encrypt (non-negotiable)

##### A1: Storage Engine (IN PROGRESS 🔨)
- Block types (BlockId, BlockRef, BlockSize) implemented
- Error types (StorageError enum with 10 variants) implemented
- Buddy allocator implementation in progress (split/merge logic)
- 4 allocator tests failing: buddy merge, free/reallocate, split-on-demand, alignment checks
- **Issue #1 created** with detailed failure analysis and debugging recommendations
- Next: Fix buddy allocator logic (merge_buddies, split_and_allocate, free list initialization)

### What's Next

**Phase 1 (In Progress):**
- A1: Storage Engine — io_uring NVMe passthrough, block allocator, FDP/ZNS placement
- A2: Metadata Service — Raft consensus, KV store, inode/directory operations
- A3: Data Reduction — BLAKE3 dedupe, LZ4/Zstd compression, AES-GCM encryption (as library)
- A4: Transport — RDMA + TCP backends, custom RPC protocol
- A9: Test & Validation — unit test harnesses, pjdfstest wrapper
- A10: Security Audit — unsafe code review, fuzzing, dependency audits

**Phase 2 (Planned):**
- A5: FUSE Client — wire to A2+A4
- A6: Replication — cross-site journal sync
- A7: Protocol Gateways — NFSv3, pNFS, S3, Samba VFS
- A8: Management — Prometheus, DuckDB, Web UI, CLI

**Phase 3 (Planned):**
- Bug fixes from validation findings
- Performance optimization
- Production-ready hardening
