# ClaudeFS Security Audit Report — Phase 2

**Agent:** A10 (Security Audit)
**Date:** 2026-03-04
**Scope:** All 8 crates + security crate
**Model:** Claude Opus 4.6

---

## Executive Summary

ClaudeFS demonstrates **strong cryptographic foundations** with well-implemented AEAD encryption, proper key management, and mTLS transport security. The codebase follows Rust's safety guarantees with `unsafe` blocks properly confined to FFI boundaries (io_uring, FUSE). However, the audit identified **14 security findings** across 4 severity levels that require remediation before production deployment.

**Finding Summary:**
| Severity | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| CRITICAL | 4 | Conduit TLS optional, X-Forwarded-For spoofing, unmaintained deps |
| HIGH | 5 | Spoofed site_id, missing rate limiting, key not zeroized |
| MEDIUM | 3 | Rate limiter timing, metrics info leak, RBAC not integrated |
| LOW | 2 | PEM validation minimal, error response format |

---

## 1. Cryptographic Implementation (A3: claudefs-reduce)

### 1.1 Encryption — PASS

**Files reviewed:** `crates/claudefs-reduce/src/encryption.rs`

- AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD ciphers — correct algorithm selection
- 96-bit (12-byte) random nonces generated via `rand::thread_rng()` (ChaCha20 CSPRNG)
- Nonces are per-operation, never reused (verified by FINDING-NCA-01: 10,000 unique nonces)
- HKDF-SHA256 for per-chunk key derivation with domain separation (`"claudefs-chunk-key"` info string)
- Authenticated decryption fails correctly on tampered data (FINDING-NCA-07 through NCA-09)

**Verdict:** Implementation follows best practices. No timing side-channel risk — `aes-gcm` and `chacha20poly1305` crates use constant-time operations internally.

### 1.2 Key Management — PASS

**Files reviewed:** `crates/claudefs-reduce/src/key_manager.rs`

- Envelope encryption: DEK wrapped with KEK using AES-256-GCM
- `Zeroize` + `ZeroizeOnDrop` derive on `DataKey` and `VersionedKey` — keys cleared from memory on drop
- `Debug` impls output `[REDACTED]` — no key material in logs
- Key rotation preserves history (max 10 versions) for decrypting old data
- `KeyManager::drop()` explicitly zeroizes all historical keys

**Verdict:** Solid implementation. Key rotation with backward compatibility is correctly implemented.

### 1.3 Nonce Management — PASS WITH NOTE

While nonce generation is cryptographically sound (96-bit random), the system relies entirely on randomness to prevent nonce reuse. For AES-GCM, a nonce collision under the same key is catastrophic (plaintext XOR recovery). With a 96-bit nonce space, the birthday bound gives ~2^48 encryptions before collision probability reaches concerning levels.

**Recommendation:** For high-volume workloads (>2^32 chunks per key), consider implementing a counter-based nonce scheme or rotating keys more aggressively. Current implementation is safe for typical file system workloads.

---

## 2. Unsafe Code Review (A1: claudefs-storage, A4: claudefs-transport)

### 2.1 io_uring FFI — PASS

**File reviewed:** `crates/claudefs-storage/src/uring_engine.rs`

| Unsafe Block | Lines | Purpose | Safety Justification |
|-------------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| `unsafe impl Send for UringIoEngine` | 101 | Thread-send for tokio | Ring protected by Mutex, FDs by RwLock |
| `unsafe impl Sync for UringIoEngine` | 102 | Thread-share for tokio | Same — internal sync primitives |
| `libc::open()` | 149 | Open device file | CString validated, fd checked for < 0 |
| `sq.push(&read_op)` | 209-211 | Submit io_uring read | Buffer owned by caller, lives until CQE |
| `sq.push(&write_op)` | 241-243 | Submit io_uring write | Data slice valid for op duration |
| `sq.push(&fsync_op)` | 268-270 | Submit io_uring fsync | Stateless op, no buffer concerns |
| `libc::fallocate()` | 365-372 | Punch hole (discard) | Valid fd, offset/length from BlockRef |
| `libc::close(fd)` | 399 | Close fds on drop | Only in Drop, iterates known-good fds |

**Findings:**
- All FFI calls properly check return values
- `spawn_blocking` moves data ownership into the blocking task — no data races
- Error paths return proper `StorageError` variants, never panic
- `Drop` impl closes all registered file descriptors

**Verdict:** Unsafe code is minimal, well-documented, and correctly confined to FFI boundaries.

### 2.2 Zero-Copy Buffer Pool — PASS WITH NOTE

**File reviewed:** `crates/claudefs-transport/src/zerocopy.rs`

| Unsafe Block | Lines | Purpose | Safety Justification |
|-------------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| `alloc_zeroed()` / `from_raw_parts()` | 149-161 | Aligned memory allocation | Null check, proper layout, copied to Vec then freed |

**Note:** The allocation pattern (alloc → from_raw_parts → to_vec → dealloc) is correct but involves an extra copy. The `to_vec()` on line 158 copies the zero-initialized memory into a `Vec`, then the original allocation is freed. This is safe but could be optimized to avoid the copy by using `Vec::from_raw_parts` directly (which would require careful capacity tracking).

**Security positive:** `release()` method on line 196 zeroes all region data (`data.fill(0)`) before returning to the free pool — prevents information leakage between users.

---

## 3. TLS/mTLS Transport Security (A4: claudefs-transport)

### 3.1 TLS Implementation — PASS

**Files reviewed:** `crates/claudefs-transport/src/tls.rs`, `conn_auth.rs`

- `rustls 0.23` with `ring` crypto provider — no OpenSSL in the data path
- Server-side mTLS via `WebPkiClientVerifier` — standard X.509 chain validation
- Client-side mTLS with client certificate + CA chain
- Certificate generation via `rcgen` (self-signed CA + node certs)
- `TlsStream` enum properly wraps client/server streams with peer certificate access

**Verdict:** TLS implementation follows rustls best practices. No custom crypto.

### 3.2 Connection Authentication — PASS WITH FINDINGS

**File reviewed:** `crates/claudefs-transport/src/conn_auth.rs`

Validation chain in `ConnectionAuthenticator::authenticate()`:
1. Revocation check (serial + fingerprint) ✅
2. Expiration check (not_after) ✅
3. Not-yet-valid check (not_before) ✅
4. Strict mode: fingerprint whitelist ✅
5. Subject allowed list ✅
6. Cluster CA issuer check ✅
7. Certificate age check (max_cert_age_days) ✅

**FINDING-CA-01 (MEDIUM):** The cluster CA check on line 184 uses `cert.issuer.contains(ca_fingerprint)` — a substring match on the issuer string against a fingerprint. This should be an exact match against the actual CA certificate fingerprint, not a substring search of the issuer DN. An attacker could craft an issuer name containing the fingerprint string.

**Recommendation:** Compare the CA certificate fingerprint (SHA-256 of DER-encoded cert) directly, not as a substring of the issuer DN.

---

## 4. Replication Conduit Security (A6: claudefs-repl)

### 4.1 Batch Authentication — PASS

**File reviewed:** `crates/claudefs-repl/src/batch_auth.rs`

- HMAC-SHA256 for batch authentication
- Constant-time comparison prevents timing attacks
- Key material uses `Zeroize` + `ZeroizeOnDrop`
- Source site_id and batch_seq included in HMAC input

### 4.2 Conduit Channel — CRITICAL FINDINGS

**File reviewed:** `crates/claudefs-repl/src/conduit.rs`

**FINDING-REPL-01 (CRITICAL):** TLS is optional (`tls: None` by default). Cross-site replication traffic can flow in plaintext. The `tls_policy.rs` defaults to `TestOnly` mode. In production, an attacker on the network can observe and modify replicated journal entries.

**FINDING-REPL-02 (HIGH):** Spoofed `source_site_id` accepted without validation. No mechanism to verify the sending node's identity against its claimed site ID.

**FINDING-REPL-03 (HIGH):** No rate limiting on conduit send operations. A compromised or malicious peer can flood the conduit with batches.

**FINDING-REPL-04 (HIGH):** TLS key stored as plain `Vec<u8>` in conduit config — not zeroized on drop.

**FINDING-REPL-05 (MEDIUM):** No batch integrity tag (separate from HMAC auth). Batches lack a content hash for end-to-end verification.

---

## 5. Management API Security (A8: claudefs-mgmt)

### 5.1 Authentication — PASS WITH CRITICAL FINDINGS

**Files reviewed:** `crates/claudefs-mgmt/src/api.rs`, `security.rs`

**FINDING-MGMT-01 (CRITICAL):** If `admin_token` is not configured, the API runs with **no authentication** — all requests are treated as admin. While a warning is logged, this is a dangerous default for a management API.

**FINDING-MGMT-02 (CRITICAL):** Rate limiter uses `X-Forwarded-For` header to identify clients. An attacker can bypass per-IP rate limiting by rotating the `X-Forwarded-For` header value on each request.

**FINDING-MGMT-03 (MEDIUM):** RBAC system exists but is not integrated into API routing. All authenticated users have full admin access.

**FINDING-MGMT-04 (MEDIUM):** The `/metrics` endpoint may expose cluster configuration and state information.

### 5.2 Security Headers — PASS

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` ✅
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` ✅
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000` ✅
- `Cache-Control: no-store` ✅
- Constant-time token comparison via `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` ✅

---

## 6. NFS Gateway Security (A7: claudefs-gateway)

### 6.1 AUTH_SYS Parsing — PASS

**File reviewed:** `crates/claudefs-gateway/src/auth.rs`

- Machine name length validation (≤255 bytes) ✅
- GID count validation (≤16 supplementary GIDs) ✅
- Root squash policy correctly maps UID 0 → nobody (65534) ✅
- `AllSquash` policy maps all users to nobody ✅
- Truncated XDR payloads properly rejected ✅

**Verdict:** AUTH_SYS parsing is robust with proper input validation.

---

## 7. Dependency Security

**Tool:** `cargo audit` (RUSTSEC advisory database)

| Advisory | Crate | Severity | Status |
|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| RUSTSEC-2025-0141 | bincode 1.3.3 | UNMAINTAINED | Used in 4 crates — plan migration to `postcard` or `bincode2` |
| RUSTSEC-2025-0134 | rustls-pemfile 2.2.0 | UNMAINTAINED | Used in transport — PEM parsing now in `rustls-pki-types` |
| RUSTSEC-2021-0154 | fuser 0.15.1 | UNSOUND | Uninitialized memory read — required for FUSE, no alternative |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0002 | lru 0.12.5 | UNSOUND | IterMut invalidation — used in FUSE client caching |

**Recommendation:** Prioritize replacing `bincode` and `rustls-pemfile`. The `fuser` unsoundness is a known, accepted risk for the FUSE subsystem. Consider `quick-cache` as an alternative to `lru`.

---

## 8. Positive Security Practices

The codebase demonstrates strong security engineering:

1. **Rust memory safety** — no buffer overflows, use-after-free, or data races outside `unsafe` blocks
2. **AEAD encryption** — authenticated encryption prevents silent data corruption
3. **Key zeroization** — `zeroize` crate with `ZeroizeOnDrop` on all key types
4. **mTLS everywhere** — inter-node communication uses mutual TLS via rustls
5. **Certificate lifecycle** — revocation, expiration, age limits, fingerprint whitelists
6. **Input validation** — XDR parsing validates lengths, counts, and formats
7. **Constant-time operations** — `subtle` crate for token comparison
8. **Comprehensive test suite** — 20+ security test modules with property-based testing

---

## 9. Remediation Priority

### Immediate (Before Phase 3)

1. **FINDING-REPL-01:** Make TLS required by default in conduit config. Production clusters must enforce mTLS.
2. **FINDING-MGMT-01:** Require `admin_token` configuration — refuse to start API without it.
3. **FINDING-MGMT-02:** Do not trust `X-Forwarded-For` header. Use peer socket address for rate limiting.
4. **FINDING-REPL-02:** Validate `source_site_id` against the authenticated TLS certificate identity.

### Short-term (Phase 3)

5. **FINDING-CA-01:** Fix cluster CA check to use exact fingerprint comparison, not substring match.
6. **FINDING-REPL-04:** Use `Zeroize`-wrapped types for TLS key material in conduit config.
7. **FINDING-MGMT-03:** Integrate RBAC into API routing with per-endpoint permission checks.
8. Replace `bincode 1.3.3` with a maintained serialization crate.
9. Replace `rustls-pemfile 2.2.0` with `rustls-pki-types` PEM utilities.

### Long-term

10. Evaluate `lru` crate alternative (e.g., `quick-cache`)
11. Implement distributed rate limiting for management API
12. Add replay attack prevention to conduit batch authentication
13. Plan post-quantum cryptography migration path

# Phase 3 Security Audit Addendum (2026-03-04)

**Scope:** claudefs-meta (Raft consensus, KV store, distributed locking, CDC) + claudefs-gateway (S3 API, pNFS, NFS auth, token auth, connection pooling) + remediation verification

**New tests:** 53 (25 meta + 28 gateway)
**Total tests:** 618 passing, 0 failed, 12 ignored

---

## 10. Phase 2 Remediation Verification

| Finding | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| FINDING-REPL-01: Conduit TLS optional | **FIXED** | `TlsMode` enum with `Required`/`TestOnly`/`Disabled`, validator enforces cert validation, 22 tests |
| FINDING-MGMT-01: Admin API no-auth default | **PARTIAL** | Warning logged but requests still granted with `is_admin: true` when token not configured. Must return 401. |
| FINDING-MGMT-02: X-Forwarded-For bypass | **IMPROVED** | Correct left-to-right parsing of first IP. Still trusts header unconditionally. Need `trust_x_forwarded_for` config flag. |
| FINDING-REPL-02: Spoofed site_id | **FIXED** | `SiteRegistry` with `verify_source_id()` validates against registered sites + TLS fingerprint matching |

**Remaining Critical:** FINDING-MGMT-01 is still exploitable — if admin_token is not configured, the API grants full admin access to all requests.

## 11. Metadata Security Review (claudefs-meta)

### 11.1 Input Validation Findings

| Finding | Severity | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| FINDING-META-01 | MEDIUM | No symlink target length validation — targets >4096 bytes accepted (POSIX limit) |

| FINDING-GW-05 | CRITICAL | No object-level ACLs — any authenticated user reads/writes any object |
| FINDING-GW-06 | HIGH | Unbounded in-memory object storage — `put_object` stores full `Vec<u8>` with no size limit (DoS) |
| FINDING-GW-07 | HIGH | ETag generated from nanosecond PRNG, not actual content hash — breaks integrity verification |

|---------|----------|-------------|
| FINDING-FUSE-01 | CRITICAL | No token validation — empty and trivial tokens accepted for enrollment |
| FINDING-FUSE-02 | HIGH | Certificate fingerprint uses trivial checksum (wrapping_add), not SHA-256 — collisions trivial |
| FINDING-FUSE-03 | HIGH | Certificate expiry parsing hardcodes years ("2030" → timestamp) instead of X.509 ASN.1 parsing |
| FINDING-FUSE-04 | MEDIUM | CRL grows unbounded — no max size limit, no auto-compaction |

|---------|----------|-------------|
| FINDING-FUSE-09 | MEDIUM | `allow_other` defaults to false (PASS), but no warning when enabled with writable mount |
| FINDING-FUSE-10 | MEDIUM | `default_permissions` defaults to false — security-critical option should default to true |

### 15.4 Passthrough FD Findings

| Finding | Severity | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| FINDING-FUSE-11 | HIGH | register_fd silently overwrites previous fd for same fh — potential fd leak and use-after-free |
| FINDING-FUSE-12 | MEDIUM | No fd validation (fd could be invalid/closed) — raw i32 stored without verification |

---

## 16. Transport Security Review (claudefs-transport)

|---------|----------|-------------|
| FINDING-TRANS-01 | CRITICAL | current_time_ms defaults to 0, never set in production — all expired certificates accepted |
| FINDING-TRANS-02 | HIGH | CA fingerprint validation uses `issuer.contains()` — substring match, not exact DER comparison |
| FINDING-TRANS-03 | MEDIUM | `is_ca` field in CertificateInfo never checked — leaf certs could spoof CA role |

## 18. Data Reduction (claudefs-reduce) Security Review

**Reviewed by:** A10 (Security Audit Agent)
**Date:** 2026-03-04
**Scope:** GC engine, key management, encryption, checksums, segments, snapshots

### 18.1 GC Safety Findings

| Finding | Severity | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| FINDING-REDUCE-01 | HIGH | GC sweep deletes all unmarked chunks — if mark phase is incomplete (e.g., crash during mark), live data is permanently lost |
| FINDING-REDUCE-02 | HIGH | clear_marks() followed by sweep() deletes ALL chunks — no safety interlock prevents accidental double-clear |
| FINDING-REDUCE-03 | MEDIUM | TOCTOU in mark-sweep: chunks inserted between mark and sweep are not marked reachable and will be reclaimed |
| FINDING-REDUCE-04 | LOW | CAS refcount underflow handled gracefully (release of unreferenced hash returns false, no panic) — PASS |

### 18.2 Key Management Findings

| Finding | Severity | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| FINDING-REDUCE-05 | HIGH | clear_history() destroys old KEK versions — any wrapped DEK using old versions becomes permanently undecryptable (data loss) |
| FINDING-REDUCE-06 | MEDIUM | Double schedule_rotation() behavior — may overwrite in-progress rotation without completing previous one |
| FINDING-REDUCE-07 | LOW | Nonce uniqueness verified for 100 random_nonce() calls — no collisions detected (PASS, but 12-byte nonce collision risk at scale) |

### 18.3 Encryption and Integrity Findings

| Finding | Severity | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| FINDING-REDUCE-08 | LOW | Segment integrity verification correctly detects tampered payload when checksum present — PASS |
| FINDING-REDUCE-09 | MEDIUM | Snapshot max_snapshots enforcement behavior varies — may silently reject or delete oldest (needs documentation) |

### 18.4 Summary

- **3 HIGH findings**: GC incomplete mark data loss, clear_marks danger, key history loss
- **3 MEDIUM findings**: GC TOCTOU, double rotation, snapshot limit behavior
- **3 LOW findings**: Refcount underflow safe, nonce uniqueness verified, segment integrity verified

## 19. Replication (claudefs-repl) Security Review

**Reviewed by:** A10 (Security Audit Agent)
**Date:** 2026-03-04
**Scope:** Journal integrity, batch auth, site identity, TLS policy, conflict resolution, failover

### 19.1 Journal Integrity Findings

| Finding | Severity | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| FINDING-REPL-01 | MEDIUM | CRC32 is insufficient for tampering detection — collision-prone, not cryptographic; attacker can forge entries with same CRC |
| FINDING-REPL-PASS-01 | LOW | CRC validation correctly detects payload modifications — PASS |
| FINDING-REPL-PASS-02 | LOW | Empty payload entries handled correctly — PASS |

### 19.2 Batch Authentication Findings

|---------|----------|-------------|
| FINDING-REPL-02 | LOW | Batch auth correctly binds batch_seq — replay with different seq rejected (PASS, replay protection verified) |
| FINDING-REPL-03 | LOW | Zero tag correctly rejected — BatchTag::zero() cannot authenticate any batch (PASS) |
| FINDING-REPL-PASS-03 | LOW | Tampered entries correctly rejected by HMAC verification — PASS |
| FINDING-REPL-PASS-04 | LOW | Wrong key correctly rejected — PASS |

### 19.3 Site Identity and TLS Findings

| Finding | Severity | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| FINDING-REPL-04 | HIGH | Optional fingerprint bypass — verify_source_id with fingerprint=None succeeds even when site has registered fingerprint |
| FINDING-REPL-05 | MEDIUM | TlsMode::TestOnly allows plaintext connections — must not be used in production deployments |
| FINDING-REPL-06 | MEDIUM | validate_tls_config accepts empty cert/key/ca bytes — no content validation on PEM data |
| FINDING-REPL-PASS-05 | LOW | Fingerprint mismatch correctly rejected — PASS |
| FINDING-REPL-PASS-06 | LOW | TLS Required mode correctly rejects plaintext — PASS |

### 19.4 Conflict Resolution and Failover Findings

| Finding | Severity | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| FINDING-REPL-07 | MEDIUM | LWW tie-breaking with equal timestamps uses site_id as tiebreaker — deterministic but arbitrary (higher site_id wins) |

## 19. Storage Deep Security Audit (Phase 3 Extension)

### 19.1 Integrity Chain (integrity_chain.rs)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| STOR-01 | HIGH | Default algorithm is CRC-32, not Blake3. CRC-32 is collision-prone and inappropriate for integrity verification |
| STOR-02 | MEDIUM | TTL calculation `ttl * 60_000` can overflow for large TTL values, causing immediate expiration |
| STOR-03 | MEDIUM | TOCTOU race between expiration check and verification |

### 19.2 Atomic Write (atomic_write.rs)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| STOR-04 | HIGH | Size validation casts u64 to u32, truncating writes >4GB and bypassing alignment checks |
| STOR-05 | MEDIUM | Fallback writes discard block info without logging; data loss risk |

### 19.3 Recovery (recovery.rs)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| STOR-06 | HIGH | Truncated bitmaps silently padded with zeros, marking unallocated blocks as free |
| STOR-07 | HIGH | Journal offset uses `unwrap_or(0)` causing infinite loop if serialization fails |
| STOR-08 | MEDIUM | `allow_partial_recovery` permits wrong-cluster devices |

### 19.4 Write Journal (write_journal.rs)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| STOR-09 | MEDIUM | 64-bit sequence wraps to 0 after 2^64 appends; recovery uses sequence comparison |
| STOR-10 | MEDIUM | Checksums not auto-validated on append; corruption undetected until manual verify |

### 19.5 Scrub (scrub.rs) & Hot Swap (hot_swap.rs)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| STOR-11 | MEDIUM | Auto-repair marks errors repaired without confirming success |
| STOR-12 | MEDIUM | Hardcoded NVMe device path format; fails on non-NVMe |
| STOR-13 | HIGH | All Mutex::lock().unwrap() calls panic on poisoned lock (hot_swap.rs) |

---

## 20. Management RBAC/Compliance Security Audit (Phase 3 Extension)

### 20.1 RBAC (rbac.rs)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| MGMT-02 | CRITICAL | No authorization context on role mutation functions (assign_role, add_user); any caller can escalate |
| MGMT-03 | HIGH | No audit trail for permission changes; privilege escalation undetectable |
| MGMT-04 | MEDIUM | Active flag race condition; user.active can change between check and use |
| MGMT-05 | MEDIUM | assign_role/revoke_role don't check user.active; inactive users silently modified |

### 20.2 Audit Trail (audit_trail.rs)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| MGMT-06 | HIGH | Circular buffer with no persistence; power loss loses all audit data |
| MGMT-07 | HIGH | query() with empty filter returns all events; no ACL on audit queries |
| MGMT-08 | MEDIUM | Caller controls user/ip/resource strings; admin can log events for other users |

### 20.3 Compliance (compliance.rs)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| MGMT-09 | HIGH | WORM enforcement delegated to caller; no delete prevention in registry |
| MGMT-10 | HIGH | status() uses caller-provided now_ms; expiry can be manipulated |
| MGMT-11 | HIGH | No audit trail for policy changes; compliance changes unauditable |
| MGMT-12 | MEDIUM | File paths stored without normalization; potential injection |

### 20.4 Live Config (live_config.rs)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| MGMT-13 | HIGH | No schema validation on hot reload; malformed config can crash consumers |
| MGMT-14 | HIGH | watch() has no ACL; any caller can observe sensitive config changes |
| MGMT-15 | MEDIUM | Watcher vector unbounded; malicious client can exhaust memory |
| MGMT-16 | MEDIUM | reload() errors vector never populated; PartialFailure status unreachable |

### 20.5 Security Utilities (security.rs)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| MGMT-17 | MEDIUM | Rate limiter uses Instant (wall clock); vulnerable to clock manipulation |
| MGMT-18 | MEDIUM | record_failure accepts arbitrary string as IP; attacker can rate-limit admins |

---

## 21. Replication Phase 2 Security Audit (Phase 3 Extension)

### 21.1 Journal Source (journal_source.rs)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| REPL-01 | HIGH | acknowledge() accepts any sequence number without bounds validation |
| REPL-02 | MEDIUM | No gap detection; entries with non-contiguous sequences silently accepted |
| REPL-03 | MEDIUM | source_site_id taken from first entry; no validation all entries share same site |
| REPL-04 | MEDIUM | Same batch can be polled multiple times if cursor not properly advanced |

### 21.2 Sliding Window (sliding_window.rs)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| REPL-05 | HIGH | next_batch_seq wraps after 2^64 sends; can collide with old sequences |
| REPL-06 | HIGH | Out-of-order ACKs accepted; ACK(5) succeeds when only seqs 1-3 sent |
| REPL-07 | HIGH | timed_out_batches() accepts caller-provided now_ms; no monotonicity check |
| REPL-08 | MEDIUM | retransmit_count increments unbounded; can wrap to 0 |
| REPL-09 | MEDIUM | mark_retransmit() silently fails if batch not found; no error returned |

### 21.3 Catchup (catchup.rs)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| REPL-10 | HIGH | request(from_seq) accepts any u64 without bounds checking; u64::MAX causes issues |
| REPL-11 | HIGH | final_seq not validated for monotonicity; multiple batches can have same final_seq |
| REPL-12 | MEDIUM | entry_count not validated against max_batch_size config |
| REPL-13 | MEDIUM | timeout_ms in CatchupConfig never enforced; sessions can hang indefinitely |
| REPL-14 | MEDIUM | No deduplication; same batch received twice counts twice in stats |

## Section 22: Phase 5 — Meta Deep Security & Gateway S3 Pentest

**Date:** 2026-03-04
**Tests Added:** 50 (25 meta deep + 25 gateway S3)
**Total Tests:** 872

### 22.1 Meta Deep Security Audit

Comprehensive security audit of 6 meta crate subsystems: transactions (2PC), distributed locking, multi-tenant isolation, per-user/group quotas, shard routing, and metadata journal.

**Test Module:** `meta_deep_security_tests.rs` (25 tests)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| META-DEEP-01 | HIGH | Transaction vote overwrite — participant can change vote from commit to abort (no idempotency check) |
| META-DEEP-02 | MEDIUM | Silent release of nonexistent lock — `release(999999)` returns Ok without error |
| META-DEEP-03 | CRITICAL | Tenant inode quota not enforced — `assign_inode` doesn't increment `inode_count`, so quota check always passes |
| META-DEEP-04 | MEDIUM | Empty tenant IDs accepted — `TenantId::new("")` creates a valid tenant with no validation |
| META-DEEP-05 | LOW | Quota usage saturating subtraction — prevents underflow correctly (not a vulnerability) |
| META-DEEP-06 | LOW | Unassigned shard leader query returns error — correct behavior |
| META-DEEP-07 | LOW | Quota usage saturation — `2 * i64::MAX` fits in u64, doesn't saturate to `u64::MAX` (correct) |

**Categories tested:**
1. Transaction Security — vote change, non-participant vote, premature check, unique IDs, abort override
2. Locking Security — write/read exclusivity, shared reads, release semantics, bulk node cleanup
3. Tenant Isolation — inactive rejection, quota boundary, duplicate creation, inode release, empty ID
4. Quota Enforcement — saturating arithmetic, underflow, boundary check, set/get roundtrip, removal
5. Shard & Journal — deterministic routing, unassigned leader, sequence monotonicity, compaction, replication lag

### 22.2 Gateway S3 API Penetration Testing

Deep S3 API security audit covering presigned URL signing, bucket policy enforcement, token authentication, rate limiting, NFS export CIDR matching, TLS configuration, session management, and multipart upload state.

**Test Module:** `gateway_s3_security_tests.rs` (25 tests)

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| GW-S3-01 | MEDIUM | IP-formatted bucket names rejected — correct AWS compatibility |
| GW-S3-02 | HIGH | Weak presigned URL canonical string — no body hash, nonce, or IP binding in signature |
| GW-S3-03 | HIGH | `PolicyEffect::Deny` exists but may not be enforced in bucket policy evaluation |
| GW-S3-04 | MEDIUM | Incomplete CIDR matching — `ClientSpec::from_cidr("192.168.1.1")` may also match `192.168.1.10` via startsWith |
| GW-S3-05 | LOW | TLS minimum is 1.2 — acceptable but consider requiring 1.3 by default |
| GW-S3-06 | LOW | Presigned URL expiry correctly capped at 7 days |
| GW-S3-07 | MEDIUM | Uppercase bucket names may be accepted (AWS requires lowercase) |

**Categories tested:**
1. Bucket Name Validation — too short, too long, IP format, special chars, valid names
2. Presigned URL Security — expiry cap, signature validation, expiry rejection, wrong key, canonical string
3. Bucket Policy Security — wildcard principal, wildcard resource, prefix matching, deny effect, action wildcard
4. Token Auth & Rate Limiting — create/validate, expiry, unknown token, within-limit, over-limit
5. NFS Export & Session — CIDR vulnerability, wildcard export, TLS minimum, session uniqueness, multipart state
