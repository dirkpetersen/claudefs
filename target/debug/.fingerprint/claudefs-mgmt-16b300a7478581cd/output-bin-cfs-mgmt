To\nimport items relative to the current and parent modules, use the `self::` and\n`super::` prefixes, respectively.\n\nIn Rust 2018 or later, paths in `use` statements are relative to the current\nmodule unless they begin with the name of a crate or a literal `crate::`, in\nwhich case they start from the crate root. As in Rust 2015 code, the `self::`\nand `super::` prefixes refer to the current and parent modules respectively.\n\nAlso verify that you didn't misspell the import name and that the import exists\nin the module from where you tried to import it. Example:\n\n```\nuse self::something::Foo; // Ok.\n\nmod something {\n    pub struct Foo;\n}\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\nIf you tried to use a module from an external crate and are using Rust 2015,\nyou may have missed the `extern crate` declaration (which is usually placed in\nthe crate root):\n\n```edition2015\nextern crate core; // Required to use the `core` crate in Rust 2015.\n\nuse core::any;\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\nSince Rust 2018 the `extern crate` declaration is not required and\nyou can instead just `use` it:\n\n```edition2018\nuse core::any; // No extern crate required in Rust 2018.\n# fn main() {}\n```\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"crates/claudefs-mgmt/src/main.rs","byte_start":98,"byte_end":107,"line_start":5,"line_end":5,"column_start":43,"column_end":52,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"use tracing_subscriber::{fmt, prelude::*, EnvFilter};","highlight_start":43,"highlight_end":52}],"label":"no `EnvFilter` in the root","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"found an item that was configured out","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[{"file_name":"/home/cfs/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/tracing-subscriber-0.3.22/src/lib.rs","byte_start":9288,"byte_end":9310,"line_start":238,"line_end":238,"column_start":12,"column_end":34,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    #![all(feature = \"env-filter\", feature = \"std\")]","highlight_start":12,"highlight_end":34}],"label":"the item is gated behind the `env-filter` feature","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"/home/cfs/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/tracing-subscriber-0.3.22/src/lib.rs","byte_start":9350,"byte_end":9359,"line_start":239,"line_end":239,"column_start":21,"column_end":30,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    pub use filter::EnvFilter;","highlight_start":21,"highlight_end":30}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0432]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: unresolved import `tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter`\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0mcrates/claudefs-mgmt/src/main.rs:5:43\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m5\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m use tracing_subscriber::{fmt, prelude::*, EnvFilter};\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                                           \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[91mno `EnvFilter` in the root\u001b[0m\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[92mnote\u001b[0m: found an item that was configured out\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0m/home/cfs/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/tracing-subscriber-0.3.22/src/lib.rs:239:21\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m238\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m     #![all(feature = \"env-filter\", feature = \"std\")]\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m            \u001b[1m\u001b[94m----------------------\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94mthe item is gated behind the `env-filter` feature\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m239\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m     pub use filter::EnvFilter;\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                     \u001b[1m\u001b[92m^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\n\n"}
